    "### what is a hash function?\n",
    "\n",
    "first, we need to know how a cryptographic hash function works. we don't need to know exactly _how_ it is calculated to know _what_ it does: it takes an input such as a sentence or a number\\* and outputs a seemingly random combination of numbers and letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say seemingly random because the result is actually __deterministic__: every time you input the word cat to the hash function [`md5`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5), for example, you get `d077f244def8a70e5ea758bd8352fcd8`. it doesn't matter which computer you use, the result is always the same.\\*\\*\n",
    "\n",
    "if you input `cate`, though, the answer is `8540d0d7e1d8111279b63983697e2e37`, which is totally unrelated to the previous output, even if the input is almost the same. these are nice properties of hash functions: we can't really guess what their output will be if we haven't already tried the input, and we can't try to guess their outputs by trying similar inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### numeral systems\n",
    "\n",
    "if you're curious about what is this combination of numbers (0-9) and letters (a-f) outputed by a hash function, keep on reading this cell, else jump to the next section. something like `8540d0d7e1d8111279b63983697e2e37` is actually a number. \"how come??\" you may ask, \"it's not made up of other numbers!\". well, yes and no. do you remember how we were taught at school that the babylonians used a different numeral system? they had 60 (!) instead of ten (0-9) numerical digits, so theirs was a [base-60 number system](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Babylonian_numerals.svg). you may also have heard that computers store information in only two numerical digits: 0 and 1. that's the binary system. same as with any unit of measurement, all of these are arbitrary and equivalent (although having ten fingers may make the decimal system easier to learn, if you're taught any of these systems at an early age all of them will seem pretty easy to you).\n",
    "\n",
    "our beloved decimal system works this way: any number is actually a sum of bases of ten. the first (from right to left) digit gets multiplied by $10^0$, the second by  $10^1$, and so on. the number 1789 is actually\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1789 \\equiv 9 \\times 10^0 + 8 \\times 10^1 + 7 \\times 10^2 + 1 \\times 10^3 \\equiv 9 + 80 + 700 + 1000 \\equiv (1789)_{10}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "binary works the same way, but with bases of 2 instead of 10: $(10110)_2$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(10110)_2 \\equiv 0 \\times 2^0 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^3 + 1 \\times 2^4 \\equiv 0 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 16 \\equiv (22)_{10}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we write $(10110)_2$ so as not confuse the reader with the number $(10110)_{10}$, i.e., ten thousand one hundred and ten, usually written as simple 10110, as the decimal system is the conventional system.\n",
    "\n",
    "now you probably see where this is going: hashes are written as hexadecimal numbers, that is, numbers of base sixteen. as we don't have numerical digits for numbers 10-15 as we do for 0-9, we use the first six letters of the alphabet (a-f). thus, the number $(1f40)_{16}$ is written in hexadecimal as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (1f40)_{16} \\equiv 0 \\times 16^0 + 4 \\times 16^1 + 15 \\times 16^2 + 1 \\times 16^3 \\equiv 0 + 64 + 3840 + 4096 \\equiv (8000)_{10}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* in computers, everything is actually a number, so it's all the same.\n",

    "### what are hash functions used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "hash functions are used to create digests (a kind of unique identifier, such as fingerprint for humans) of a long stream of data. suppose you have written a very long text on a public computer and forgot to save it on your pendrive, but you did save its hash, which was `bf9d8e46b4edcd49fd5993b8a4105b54`. on the following day you come back to the public computer to save your text, and thankfully it is still there. but how can you know if no one has changed it? if it were a very small change, you would have to skim through every letter to make sure everything is the same. but you can also hash the text again: if the output is the same, it is overwhelmingly likely that the text is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "before internet connection speeds and reliability improved, it was common to download a corrupted file from the internet, specially if what you were trying to download was a big file. to make sure you knew when this happened, the page which offered the download usually offered its hash too. that way you could hash whatever you had downloaded, and if the hash matched with the one on the webpage, it meant that your file was overwhelmingly likely to be uncorrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "you may have noticed that I did not say that when the output of two hash functions are the same it means that their input is the same. this is because you can input __anything__ to a hash function, but it will always output a hexadecimal number of a certain length. this implies that it is impossible for a hash function to garantee that every input will get a unique hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "the difference between a cryptographic and a non-cryptographic hash function is that it is easier to find hash collisions on the latter than on the former. a hash collision, as you may have guessed, is when two inputs have the same hash/digest. the `md5` hash function is not considered to be [collision resistant anymore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Security), so its cryptographic use is not recommended. \n",
    "\n",
    "if we take another hash function, such as `sha256`, we can see why it is overwhelmingly unlikely that two different inputs will map to the same output. the `sha256` takes any input and outputs a number between zero and $2^{256}$. that is so because the output of the `sha256` hash function is a 64-digit hexadecimal number. as each digit in a hexadecimal number can take 16 values, we have $16^{64}$ possibilities, which is the same as $2^{256}$ possibilities. $2^{256}$ is __huge__ number, so we would have to try a __lot__ of inputs before finding two different ones with the same output. \n",
    "\n",
    "this is so because of the property of cryotographic hash functions that we have discussed before: there is no (known) way of choosing an input that matches a given hash, so the best someone can do if they want a particular hash, say `cbdc2cb757153cb0da7501baf45c076112501f88c35d99395c93acdbcae83a8b`, is to randomly try **several** values until it is found. because there are $2^{256}$ possible values in a `sha256` function, no one is likely to succeed at doing so in a reasonable amount of time ([less than several thousand years with current hardware](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/127561/how-long-would-it-take-to-generate-a-file-to-match-a-hash))."

    "by using a schema called proof-of-work, invented by [adam back back in 1997](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf). (the version employed here is a simplified variant).\n",
    "\n",
    "although we can't find an input that will map exactly to a certain hash, it is relatively easy to find an input that hashes to a _similar_ digest --- depending on how you define similar. this is what adam back called a _partial hash collision_. we could define a similar digest as a hash that shares a certain number of digits with the desired hash, or as a hash which is not far from the desired output, as in $| hash\\_candidate - desired\\_hash| < 10^5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "in a proof-of-work schema like the one adam back imagined or the one used in the Bitcoin protocol, though, the partial hash collision sought is defined as finding a hash (remember, a hash is a hexadecimal number) below a certain target. in the case of `sha256`, finding one target among $2^{256}$ possibilities is expected to take centuries long using today's computer resources, but finding a digest below a certain target is much more feasible. this is called a proof-of-work because if you have a hash matching this requirement, it means that you had to perform a certain amount of work on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "imagine a simple hash functions that takes any input and maps it to a number between 1 and 100. if I need to find some input that hashes to exactly 42, it will take me longer than finding an input that hashes to any number below 10. it may happen that I find a hash below 10 on my first try, but on average this will take me 10 tries. so if I present you an input that hashes to a number below 10, you know that I have probably performed work proportional to 10 tries."
